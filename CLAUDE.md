# Veri-BE: Agent Entry Point

> **CRITICAL**: All AI agents working on this project MUST follow the protocols and documentation standards defined in **`AGENTS.md`**.

## Key Instructions
1.  **Read `AGENTS.md` first**: This contains the mandatory workflow and file lifecycle rules.
2.  **Consult `.agents/context/`**: For detailed project overview, architecture, and testing conventions.
3.  **Follow `.agents/plan/`**: For ongoing roadmaps and task backlogs.
4.  **Adhere to Standards**: Mimic existing patterns (CQS, Rich Domain Models, Stub-based Integration Tests).
